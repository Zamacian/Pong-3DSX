# Pong-3DSX
## Description
A simple Nintendo 3DS version of Pong .
It was made using Citro2D from devkitPro and written in C .

I made the same game for the Switch :

## Commands
Use UP and DOWN on the D-Pad to move the left paddle .
Use X and B to move the right paddle .

You can exit by pressing "SELECT" at any moment.

"START" will start the game if it isn't already .

Because I don't have a "NEW" model of the 3DS, I don't know how the program will react to the C-Stick.
